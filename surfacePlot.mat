# Import your data set in the workspace as numerical matrix.
# Tip: If your data is initially from excel, save the sheet to ".csv" and removing headers is recommended. 
# Maintain the numerical (value) matrix for surface plotting.
# Considering the data is saved as variable "matrix"
# If not, you may save your data set to a variable by:
matrix = <Name of your data set>;

# create a dummy "x" and "y" variable from the size of your matrix
[x,y] = meshgrid(1:size(matrix,2), 1:size(matrix,1));

# Create surface plot with the matrix variable
surf(x,y,matrix);

# Reverse the z-axis level
set(gca, 'ZDir', 'reverse');

# Change the z-limits
zlim([0,25]);

# Smoothen the plot by interpolation of data
# Create a variable that will hold the resolution factor
# The resolution factor is variable depending on your requirement
resolution = 128;

# Increase the grid line interval by using linspace
[x1 , y1] = meshgrid(linspace(1,size(matrix,2),resolution), linspace(1,size(matrix,1),resolution)); 

# Save the interpolated data in variable "inter_matrix"
inter_matrix = interp2(x,y,matrix,x1,y1,'spline');

# Create surface plot with the interpolated matrix
surf(x1,y1,inter_matrix);
set(gca, 'ZDir', 'reverse');
zlim([0,25]);
